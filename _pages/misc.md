**Magic**: I've been practicing magic🪄 since middle school, and I'm an active member of the PKU Magic Club. I've performed on:

- Peking University Magic Show $(\times 4)$.
- The New Year Gala of the School of Psychology and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University.
- The New Year Gala of the College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University.
- [Lu Chen](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Chen_(magician)>)'s Lectures hosted by Tsinghua University.

You can watch some of my perfomance [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BMHwz3Ee8/) and [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1vr421778j/?spm_id_from=333.1387.homepage.video_card.click)!
