👋Hi! I’m Mingyu Li (李鸣宇), an undergraduate in the [Turing Class of Computer Science](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research centers on **generative modeling and controllable content synthesis** (e.g. fine-grained control of talking-face video and human motions). Rather than focusing on a single modality or architecture, I’m excited about the shared principles that allow models to grow complex high-dimensional data from noise, and about making these generations more controllable, efficient, and aligned with human preferences.

I have been fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Hao Tang](https://ha0tang.github.io/), [Prof. Zeyu Zheng](https://zheng80.github.io/) and [Prof. Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io/). These collaborations have significantly shaped how I choose research problems, structure solutions, and write papers, and they further strengthened my motivation to keep working deeply in generative modeling.
