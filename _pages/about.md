👋Hi! I’m Mingyu Li (李鸣宇), an undergraduate in the [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). Prior to that, I learned informatics in [BDFZ](https://www.pkuschool.edu.cn) and got a **silver medal** in the National Olympiad of Informatics (NOI 2021).

My "ultimate" research goal is to build **world models** that unify generation and understanding :)  Motivated by this, I currently work on **generative** methods for controllable high-dimensional content (e.g. talking-face video and human motion), focusing on precise and efficient control of complex behaviors. I am also very interested in the **understanding** side, since I believe that unifying generation and understanding is a necessary step toward truly powerful world models.

I have been fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Hao Tang](https://ha0tang.github.io/), [Prof. Zeyu Zheng](https://zheng80.github.io/) and [Prof. Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io/). These collaborations have significantly shaped how I choose research problems, structure solutions, and write papers, and they further strengthened my motivation and research interests.
