- **GameAI**: I developed game AIs based on deep learning and MCTS for [Chinese Standard Mahjong](https://themahjongline.com/pages/how-to-play-chinese-mahjong) and [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi)! The AIs are currently ranked 45/751 (Mahjong) and 63/726 (Othello) on [Botzone](https://en.botzone.org.cn/), a widely used competitive game-AI platform in China.

- **Competitive Programming Problems**: Try to solve my counting problem [here](http://poj.openjudge.cn/campus2025/G/)!
